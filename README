php-nudity-filter is PHP port of nude.js by Patrick Wied at https://github.com/pa7/nude.js

Note: This class is not fully optimized, and some feature missing if compared to the
original JS. When these feature added, there's some performance degrade will occur.
However, the porting phase is complete, and it still needs some optimization and
further tests
